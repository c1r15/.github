# Privacy Policy

Ciris (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use Ciris.
            
1. Data Collection and Use

We prioritize your privacy and receive only analytics information like the number of active users, the number of entries.
    •    Personal Data: Ciris does not store any unencrypted personal data. Any data you provide, including all entries are securely encrypted on your device and stored in iCloud encrypted using your password or FaceID. We do not have access to the unencrypted content of your entries.
    •    Usage Data: We do not use any 3rd party software for monitoring user activity and only have metrics provided by our users if they choose in device settings to share usage data with developers. Usage data doesn't contain personaly identifying information - this refers to device types and frequency of use.

2. Data Security

We take extensive measures to secure your data:
    •    Encryption: All personal data stored in Ciris is encrypted using advanced encryption methods, ensuring that only you can access your entries.
    •    Device-Based Storage: Your data is stored locally on your device. We store the encrypted copy of data in iCloud only you can decrypt with your password or FaceID. This is only to support securely syncing your data to your devices linked to your Apple account.

3. Data Sharing and Selling

    •    No Data Selling: We do not sell, rent, or trade any data provided by our users, including anonymized or aggregated data.
    •    No Data Sharing: Your personal data is not shared with any third parties unless explicitly authorized by you, or required by law.

4. Purpose of Data Collection

Our purpose is to provide a secure, private experience that enables our users to use the app as they wish privately and securely. The limited data we utilize is provided from the Apple Developer program and is used to determine which devices are using our app, or experiencing performance issues, crashes etc.

5. User Rights

As a user of Ciris, you have full control over your data:
    •    Access: You can view, edit, or delete your data at any time directly within the app.
    •    Data Deletion: You may delete your data at any time by removing it from the app. Once deleted, the data cannot be recovered.
    *   If you were to lose access to your Apple Account we would be unable to restore your data for you as one of your Apple devices would need to be authenticated in order to recover your encryption key.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.

If we make significant changes, we will provide a notice in the app or via other means.
